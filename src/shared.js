                        <br />
                        A survey was conducted with a total of <span className="highlight_textint">38</span> participants. The participants were brokers  from individual firms and real estate agencies in New Delhi. <br />
                        Here are some key takeaways:<br />
                        • <span className="highlight_textint">81.57%</span> Brokers were supporting the idea of a platform where they can browse for client’s requirements and send proposals.<br />
                        • <span className="highlight_textint">31.5%</span> brokers were skeptical about submitting proposals as they were not clear how the platform would handle proposals for the same property.<br />
                        • Most of the users welcomed the idea of a contact representative who can mediate with clients and brokers.<br />
                        • <span className="highlight_textint">52%</span> of users wanted to have some kind of training or help to understand how the system would work as they represented an age group of over 45 years old and were not comfortable using the new platform.<br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We also conducted <span className="highlight_textint">interviews</span> with potential <span className="highlight_textint">tenants</span>, their local <span className="highlight_textint">brokers</span> as well as users who were brokers in New Delhi. <br />
                        Interview Report in brief:<br />
                        • Most concerns were raised from the tenant side as they had a <span className="highlight_textint">bias</span> that real estate agents and brokers in India are not that professional and try to deceive them and make a skewed agreement of property leaning in favor of the landlord.<br />
                        • <span className="highlight_textint">85%</span> of the tenants' side users and their real estate agents also had a <span className="highlight_textint">preconceived notion</span> that the majority of brokers in India aren't properly trained and have poor public skills<br />
                        • They also had a common request that after signing an agreement for a property they wanted some additional services like help in setting up the place , household help, etc<br />
                    </span>,
